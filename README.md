PixeIMP
This Python script provides a simple implementation of image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation. The encryption algorithm shuffles the pixels of the image based on a random permutation generated from a given key.

How to Use:

Install Requirements: Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
Bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

Run the Script: Execute the Python script (python3 PixeIMP.py) 
Mode: Select "encrypt" or "decrypt".
Image Path: Specify the path to the image file. e.g /home/love/inward.jpeg
Key: Enter a numerical key for encryption/decryption.
Save Name:Enter a desired filename for the saved image. e.g outward.jpeg
Output: The encrypted or decrypted image will be saved to the specified path (or a default filename if not provided)
